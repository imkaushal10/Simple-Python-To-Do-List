# Mission Statement

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to contribute meaningful improvements to a simple open-source Python application while learning open-source collaboration practices. The project is intentionally simple to make it accessible to beginners and serve as a learning platform for open-source development.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, we aim to gain hands-on experience with:

- **Version Control** — Using Git for tracking changes and managing code
- **Collaborative Development** — Working as a team on a shared codebase
- **Open-Source Workflow** — Following industry-standard practices for contributing to open-source projects
- **Code Documentation** — Writing clear README files and inline documentation
- **Testing** — Performing manual testing and validation of features
- **Project Management** — Planning features, dividing tasks, and meeting deadlines

## Our Workflow

We followed a standard open-source workflow throughout this project:

1. **Fork** the original repository to our own accounts
2. **Create feature branches** for each change or enhancement
3. **Commit and push** updates to our forks with descriptive messages
4. **Open pull requests** to demonstrate the OSS workflow
5. **Review and merge** branches after team review

## Why This Project?

This To-Do List application provides an ideal foundation for learning because:

- It's simple enough for beginners to understand completely
- It has clear opportunities for meaningful enhancements
- It demonstrates practical software development concepts
- It allows us to practice real-world collaboration techniques

## Course Context

This project was developed as part of an open-source software development course, where the emphasis is on learning the collaborative processes and best practices used in the open-source community, rather than just writing code.
